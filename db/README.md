# DATA source

## reference genome of CONTAMINATION

- Escherichia_coli_BL21 was downloaded from NCBI: CP001509.3
- Staphylococcus_sp.\_MZ1 was download from NCBI: CP076025.1
- Parainfluenza_virus_5 was downloaded from NCBI: NC_006430.1
- Mycoplasma_sp genomes were manually curatted from common lab contamination strains

## reference sequence of GENES (from _Mus musculus_)

- non-coding small RNA genes, including tRNA, snoRNA, miRNA, ... etc were downloaded from NCBI with duplicated records removed.
- rRNA genes. rRNA genes were assembled and patched by myself, because the one in NCBI does not shows good quality.
